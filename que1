Explain why Java is platform independent ?

Because Java is platform uses a virtual machine and the virtual machine takes care of the differences between the
 byte codes or the different platforms. The java programming language and all APIs are complied into byte codes and
 it's works on write once and run anywhere principle. JVM complies java code and convert it into byte code instead 
 of some machine specific code.
